The purpose of this app was to find your name in the digits of PI. 
But my main problem was that there were 40TB of digits of PI so it would take too much time to find your name.
So instead, after making the views (in 1h) I just made a random function to return a number.

It's still fun to use it!
What does it matter if your name is in the digit 3643765433 or on another? 
Also, the digit in PI where your name is located depends on the encoding you use.
So the digit that my app return is correct using a specific encoding  XD.

To install just run
